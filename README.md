# Camren A. | Portfolio (game designer / programmer)
Hello, I’m **Camren** - a self‑taught game developer who’s been creating videogame projects **since elementary school**. Now as an adult, I constantly channel that **lifelong passion** into crafting interactive worlds that feel truly alive. I specialize in **Unity and C#**, balancing gameplay feel with technical polish. Over the years I’ve tackled **audio programming**, multiplayer networking, **custom physics systems**, and more — always refining my skills through hands‑on projects and creative problem solving. My perfectionist nature drives me to become **aware of the details** and deliver polished results.

# Recent Projects 
## Advanced Character Controller (Unity Asset) 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 122024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c676e2-6e5a-4ba7-a0fb-605d00ec6eb9)
This project showcases my experience with 3D physics, inverse-kinematics (IK), animation, graphic/visual art + effects, raycasting, and unity engine custom editors. You start with a empty game object, the character controller script only asks for a rigged humanoid 3D model, then it converts it into a viewmodel and the shadows are generated, this system finalizes the process by quickly allowing you to boot into a life like character in a mtter of seconds. To make a great character controller it required me to learn how the ' Transform ' component in Unity truly works. This project began as a necessity for a game I was developing, leading me to create a Unity Asset utilizing code I originally wrote in 2015. The result is a comprehensive character controller system featuring unique and advanced functionalities. Initially, the controller lacked a dynamic feel, to address this, I developed my signature version of a "headbob" & animation system. Today, it's clearly evolved into a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that can definately compete with other similar modern day systems. Built entirely from scratch, this project is a good example of my ability to create industry standard tools. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation).

This project showcases my experience with audio programming, Unity Events, C++ VST3 plugin hosting, ' .WAV ' file configuration, generate new audio files using procedural generation, and mastery of UI/UX systems. I
took Unity's UI system and created a software, since it's powered by Unity this allows unlimited possibilities for visuals. You can make any type of song you would like and browse your local files for use in a project. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation).
