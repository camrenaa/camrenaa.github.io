# CAMREN A. (PORTFOLIO)
Hello, Iâ€™m Camren, a selfâ€‘taught game developer who has been actively developing videogame projects since elementary schoolâ€”this obsession with crafting experiences remained, and here I am as an adult, dedicated to bringing interactive worlds to life. 


About Me:
Iâ€™m passionate about building systems that feel aliveâ€”my tools of choice are Unity and C#, and I focus on both gameplay feel and technical polish 
Due to this being a lifelong hoby of mine, I have grown a VERY special relationship with everything game dev related. Over the years Iâ€™ve explored many subjects throught my journey such as audio progamming,  multiplayer networking, advanced custom physics systems, and beyond... Honing my skills through handsâ€‘on projects and creative problem solving, im not just a hobyist, i have true passion for being a part of any videogame's development.


Skills & Approach
Unity & C# â€“ Skilled in objectâ€‘oriented game systems and editor scripting.
Gameplay Mechanics â€“ Crafting responsive movement, camera controls, and player feedback loops 

Visuals & Graphics â€“ Designing UI/UX elements and graphic assets to enhance immersion in both 2D & 3D

Performance Optimization â€“ Profiling and refining code for smooth realâ€‘time gameplay. I have a perfectionist personality type, meaning I pay close attention to detail and make sure ALL my work is the best it could be.
