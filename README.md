# Recent Projects 
## Advanced Character Controller (Unity Asset) [<ins>*2025*</ins>]
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 122024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c676e2-6e5a-4ba7-a0fb-605d00ec6eb9)
This project began as a necessity for a game I was developing, leading me to create a Unity Asset utilizing code I originally wrote in 2015. The result is a comprehensive character controller system featuring unique and advanced functionalities. Initially, the controller lacked a dynamic feel, to address this, I developed my signature version of a "headbob" & animation system. Today, it's clearly evolved into a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that can definately compete with other similar modern day systems.
### Key Features :
+ <ins>Modular Design</ins> : Easily switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, everything can be modified to the users desired look & feel.
+ <ins>Procedural Viewmodel Generation</ins> : Automatically generates first-person viewmodels and animations from any 3D character model, utilizes inverse-kinematics to polish the experience.
+ <ins>Advanced Custom Movement Mechanics</ins> : The user can essentially create custom movements beyond the traditional crouch, prone, jump, sprint, etc.
+ <ins>User-Friendly Integration</ins> : Designed for seamless integration into various game projects, reducing setup time.
This asset is crafted to provide developers with a robust and flexible character controller, streamlining the development process and enhancing gameplay experience.
