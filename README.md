# Camren A. | Portfolio (game programmer)
Hello, I’m **Camren** - a self‑taught game developer who’s been creating videogame projects **since elementary school**. Now as an adult, I constantly channel that **lifelong passion** into crafting interactive worlds that feel truly alive. I specialize in **Unity and C#**, balancing gameplay feel with technical polish. Over the years I’ve tackled **audio programming**, multiplayer networking, **custom physics systems**, and more — always refining my skills through hands‑on projects and creative problem solving. My perfectionist nature drives me to become **aware of the details** and deliver polished results.

## Advanced Character Controller (Unity Asset) [<ins>*2025*</ins>]
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 122024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c676e2-6e5a-4ba7-a0fb-605d00ec6eb9)
This project began as a necessity for a game I was developing, leading me to create a Unity Asset utilizing code I originally wrote in 2015. The result is a comprehensive character controller system featuring unique and advanced functionalities. Initially, the controller lacked a dynamic feel, to address this, I developed my signature version of a "headbob" & animation system. Today, it's clearly evolved into a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that can definately compete with other similar modern day systems.
