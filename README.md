# Camren A. | Portfolio (game designer / programmer)
Hello, I’m **Camren** - a self‑taught game developer who’s been creating videogame projects **since elementary school**. Now as an adult, I constantly channel that **lifelong passion** into crafting interactive worlds that feel truly alive. I specialize in **Unity and C#**, balancing gameplay feel with technical polish. Over the years I’ve tackled **audio programming**, multiplayer networking, **custom physics systems**, and more — always refining my skills through hands‑on projects and creative problem solving. My perfectionist nature drives me to become **aware of the details** and deliver polished results.

## Advanced Character Controller (Unity Asset) 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 122024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c676e2-6e5a-4ba7-a0fb-605d00ec6eb9)

This project showcases my experience with 3D physics, inverse-kinematics (IK), animation, graphic/visual art + effects, raycasting, and unity engine custom editors. You start with a empty game object, the character controller script only asks for a rigged humanoid 3D model, then it converts it into a viewmodel and the shadows are generated, this system finalizes the process by quickly allowing you to boot into a life like character in a mtter of seconds. To make a great character controller it required me to learn how the ' Transform ' component in Unity truly works. This project began as a necessity for a game I was developing, leading me to create a Unity Asset utilizing code I originally wrote in 2015. The result is a comprehensive character controller system featuring unique and advanced functionalities. Initially, the controller lacked a dynamic feel, to address this, I developed my signature version of a "headbob" & animation system. Today, it's clearly evolved into a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that can definately compete with other similar modern day systems. Built entirely from scratch, this project is a good example of my ability to create industry standard tools. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation). Use of libraries are minimal to none to reduce potential threat of errors after update.

## Unity Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) Game

This project showcases my experience with audio programming, Binary file saving/loading, Unity Events, C++ VST3 plugin hosting, ' .WAV ' file configuration, generate new audio files using procedural generation, and mastery of UI/UX systems. I
took Unity's UI system and created a software, since it's powered by Unity this allows unlimited possibilities for visuals. You can make any type of song you would like and browse your local files for use in a project. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation). Original project was created in 2019, but I have restarted the project from scractch many times, doubling down on my audio programming experience. I had to learn C & C++ basics to get VST3 plugins to work, I also had to utilize a .NET Core console backend to handle all the buffer data. Use of libraries are minimal to none to reduce potential threat of errors after update.

## Multiplayer 2D Platformer Shooter Arcade Game 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 174558](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/070dfc62-a8aa-4b40-815d-edacfe59d90e)

This project showcases my ability to create a multiplayer game and a immersive 2D experience using 2D physics. The multiplayer originally utilized Photon Networking asset, but later i created a dedicated server system using a (.dll) file which stored my custom networking library code. Everything is built from scratch. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation). Use of libraries are minimal to none to reduce potential threat of errors after update.

This project showcases my experience with creating active ragdolls from scratch, volumetric weather mechanics, time of day systems, weapon mechanics, inventory systems, and crafring systems. For this project i had to learn how to make story based games, I also had to learn how to procedurally generate worlds entirely from code. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation). Use of libraries are minimal to none to reduce potential threat of errors after update.

## Advanced Footstep System (Unity Asset)

For this, all potential texture are linked to a "ground type" of material, each material type is linked to a list of audio clips, then I had to find a way to detect what texture is under the player at any given moment in order to play the correct audio. An issue would occur if the texture has no registered audio clips attached to it, so the system simply plays the default footstep and makes a good judgement on the volume, pitch, and overall sound manipulation of each footstep. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation).

This project showcases my skills with fractals, & procedural generation, as for this i had to learn F-trees, fractals, gizmos, and procedural generation. All objects are generated from code. At the press of a button an entire city based on your own custom configuration is generated instantly. Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation). Use of libraries are minimal to none to reduce potential threat of errors after update.

This was the first project i attempted to publish, the project that started my journey on tackling steam. For this i had to utilize my own custom character controller,  Everything is generated on the fly upon playing the application and I always make my scripts fully modular so they can be easily modifed, also I write proper documentation for every system I create to "future-proof" the components of a project, I create every script in a way that potential future depreciation of unity components won't affect the project much, kinda like a stop loss (less errors due to depreciation).
