# Camren A. | Portfolio (game designer / programmer)
Hello, Iâ€™m **Camren** - a selfâ€‘taught game developer whoâ€™s been creating videogame projects **since elementary school**. Now as an adult, I constantly channel that **lifelong passion** into crafting interactive worlds that feel truly alive. I specialize in **Unity and C#**, balancing gameplay feel with technical polish. Over the years Iâ€™ve tackled **audio programming**, multiplayer networking, **custom physics systems**, and more â€” always refining my skills through handsâ€‘on projects and creative problem solving. My perfectionist nature drives me to become **aware of the details** and deliver polished results.

# Recent Projects 
## Advanced Character Controller (Unity Asset) 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 122024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c676e2-6e5a-4ba7-a0fb-605d00ec6eb9)

This project showcases my experience with Unityâ€™s Transform system, inverse kinematics, animation rigging, physics, raycasting, and custom editor scripting. I developed a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that procedurally generates viewmodels, shadows, and animations from a single humanoid 3D model. To achieve this, I built my own head-bob system, implemented IK constraints, and wrote custom Unity Editor tools for fast setup. The controller was originally born out of necessity for a game I was developing and has since evolved into an advanced Unity asset that prioritizes modularity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## Unity Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) Game

This project highlights my experience with audio programming, local directory handling, .NET Core, binary file I/O, C++ VST3 plugin hosting, and procedural audio generation. I designed a DAW-like software using Unityâ€™s UI system, enabling real-time song creation and seamless browsing of local audio files. To support advanced audio features, I integrated a .NET Core backend for buffer processing and learned C/C++ fundamentals to implement VST3 support. The system is modular, visually customizable, like all of my projects. Originally started in 2019, Iâ€™ve rebuilt the project multiple times to refine both functionality and my understanding of real-time audio systems.

## Multiplayer 2D Platformer Shooter Arcade Game 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 174558](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/070dfc62-a8aa-4b40-815d-edacfe59d90e)

This project demonstrates my ability to build a fully custom 2D multiplayer game using Unity and MySQL for player login and registration. It began with Photon Networking but later evolved into a dedicated server system powered by a custom networking library compiled into a .dll. The entire experienceâ€”from physics and visuals to networkingâ€”is built from scratch, with all systems generated dynamically at runtime. Also this code is fully modular.

## Open-world MMO survival Game
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 133615](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce402ad5-d434-4f41-8076-5c082f67ccb1)

This project highlights my work in building complex systems such as active ragdolls, VFX particles, shaders, lighting, volumetric weather, time-of-day cycles, weapon mechanics, gibs/gore, inventory, and craftingâ€”entirely from scratch. I also developed a procedural world generation system and explored the structure of narrative-driven gameplay. Every component is dynamically generated at runtime, written with modularity and future-proofing in mind. My usual approach avoids reliance on third-party libraries.

## Advanced Footstep System (Unity Asset)
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 125523](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf35ceef-72ba-4efe-a712-e375e4edbd45)

This system dynamically detects the texture beneath the player and plays the appropriate footstep sound based on linked "ground type" materials, each associated with a library of audio clips. If no clip is assigned to a texture, it defaults to a generic sound with adaptive pitch, volume, and tone. Built entirely from scratch, the system is fully modular, self-contained, and optimized to minimize external dependencies.

## Procedural City/Town Generation (Unity Asset) 
![Screenshot 2025-05-03 130028](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7958be2-63eb-464c-bb4f-815b2bb89969)

This project demonstrates my skills in procedural generation and fractal systems, including F-trees and Unity gizmos. Every object in the city is generated entirely from codeâ€”at the press of a button, a fully custom city forms instantly based on user-defined settings. The system is fully modular and built from scratch.

## Multiplayer Classic FPS sniper Game

This was the first project I attempted to publish and marked the beginning of my journey toward releasing on Steam. I built a custom character controller, implemented weapon and FPS mechanics, and designed the full gameplay loop with player-focused quality-of-life features. Everything is generated dynamically at runtime, with modular scripts.

## Developer Console System w/ Custom commands
![Screenshot 2025-05-04 011350](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4e3aae9-851b-4b80-a390-7f8bc0d93abf)

This project demonstrates my skills with Unity Events and referencing external code both inside and outside of Unity. I created a developer console tool that allows users to define and trigger custom commands via UI input, dynamically linking typed commands to methods. Everything is generated at runtime, with modular, well-documented scripts designed to be resilient.

Iâ€™ve been composing music since 2014 and have built a personal library of thousands of sample tracks, ready to be customized and adapted to fit a wide range of video game styles and composition needs.

I use my knowledge of digital synthesizers, foley recording, and audio programming to craft custom sound effects that enhance immersion and bring dynamic audio experiences to life.
