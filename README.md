## Character Controller (Unity Asset) [<ins>*in-progress*</ins>]
This project began as a necessity for a game I was developing, leading me to create a Unity Asset utilizing code I originally wrote in 2015. The result is a comprehensive character controller system featuring unique and advanced functionalities. Initially, the controller lacked a dynamic feel. To address this, I developed my own signature version of a "headbob" system, a separate project I began working on at age 15 (2015). Today, it's clearly evolved into a fully modular first-person and third-person character controller that can definately compete with other similar modern day systems.
### Key Features :
+ <ins>Modular Design</ins> : Easily switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, everything can be modified to the users desired look & feel.
+ <ins>Procedural Viewmodel Generation</ins> : Automatically generates first-person viewmodels and animations from any 3D character model, utilizes inverse-kinematics to polish the experience.
+ <ins>Advanced Custom Movement Mechanics</ins> : The user can essentially create custom movements beyond the traditional crouch, prone, jump, sprint, etc.
+ <ins>User-Friendly Integration</ins> : Designed for seamless integration into various game projects, reducing setup time.
This asset is crafted to provide developers with a robust and flexible character controller, streamlining the development process and enhancing gameplay experience.
